I have about 20 days worth of started projects. Im learning new concepts, expanding on those concepts, not finishing projects because of features
I wanted to add, then going back and relearning the lesson plan. Anyways, I just finished lesson 4, feature complete. Im also learning the importance of
revisions. once I create revisions for the other projects and lectures I'll post them, so if anything, future me will be able to look back on my progress.

**non python related. I picked up advanced C programming over the last week. I havent and wont start it yet, but its there. Same professor as my beginner
C class. He definitely knows his stuff; a little hard to follow sometimes but I think that is an accidental byproduct of intellegence, the ability to be
five steps ahead mentally but still trying to explain it in a way someone 5 steps behind and comprehend.
Still learning more every day. Hopefully by the end of the year I'll have a decent grasp on python at an intermediate level, and then from there start
transcribing this classes lesson plans to C while I try to grasp the beginner concepts.
